description: How to pass emails between commandlets using the pipeline.

For many tasks you can "pipe" output from a cmdlet (like [`New-MSGraphMail`](../commandlets/new/New-MSGraphMail.mdx)) into further commandlets to take action on the object you just created or fetched.

You can pipe emails into [`Send-MSGraphMail`](../commandlets/send/Send-MSGraphMail.mdx) to send them, into [`Move-MSGraphMail`](../commandlets/move/Move-MSGraphMail.mdx) to move them to another folder, or into [`Remove-MSGraphMail`](../commandlets/remove/Remove-MSGraphMail.mdx) to delete them.

When using the pipeline you should pass the parameter `-Pipeline` to the commandlet which generates the objects you want to pipe. This will make sure that the objects are in a suitable format for the next commandlet to process them.
