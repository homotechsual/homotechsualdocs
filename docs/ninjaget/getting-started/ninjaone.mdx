NinjaGet needs a little preparation of your Ninja instance before it can be used. This page will walk you through the steps required to get NinjaGet up and running in your environment.

## Fields

For NinjaGet to work we need to create some custom fields in NinjaOne. We need the following fields:

In the permissions column below, `S` means the permissions for `Automations` formerly labelled as `Scripts`. `T` means the permissions for `Technicians` and `A` means the permissions for `API`.

| Purpose                       | Type       | Name Used In Docs | Permissions                         | Role/Global | Definition Scopes       | 
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Store the last run date/time. | Date/Time  | NGLastRun         | S: Write T: Read A: None        | Role        | N/A                     |
| Store the last run status.    | Text       | NGLastRunStatus   | S: Write T: Read A: None        | Role        | N/A                     |
| Store apps to install.        | Multiline  | NGInstall         | S: Read T: Read / Write A: None | Global      | Organisation + Location |
| Store apps to uninstall.      | Multiline  | NGUninstall       | S: Read T: Read / Write A: None | Global      | Organisation + Location |

The `NGInstall` and `NGUninstall` fields are used to store the list of apps to install and remove respectively. These are multiline fields, so you can store multiple apps in them. The format of the apps in the field is as follows:

```text
Application.Id
Application.Id
Application.Id
```

## Automations (Scripts)

In NinjaOne you'll have a minimum of two automations (scripts) to create. One to deploy NinjaGet to the devices and run the `Setup` operation. Then one to run the "Install" operation, which you'll probably want to run on a schedule.

Depending on whether you choose to use the Task Scheduler to handle running app updates or not, you may decide to create a third automation which handles the "Update" operation.

### Install NinjaGet

An [example install script](../index.mdx#example-install-script) is provided on the overview page. This script will download the latest version of NinjaGet from your fork of the main repository and run the `Setup` operation. You can use this script as a starting point for your own script.

### Invoke NinjaGet

Invoking NinjaGet is done by triggering the `NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1` script with the appropriate parameters. Assuming you kept the defaults this file is at `$ENV:ProgramData\NinjaGet\NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1`. But we'll pull the install location out of the registry to be sure.

#### Process Mode

Process mode is the "all in one" mode of operation which handles processing installs, uninstalls and updates. It's the default mode of operation and the one you'll probably use most often.

```powershell
$NinjaGetInstallPath = Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NinjaGet' -Name 'InstallPath' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'InstallPath'
if (-not($NinjaGetInstallPath)) {
    Write-Error -Message 'NinjaGet doesn't appear to be installed.'
    Exit 1
}
$NinjaGetEntryPoint = Join-Path -Path $NinjaGetInstallPath -ChildPath 'NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1'
if (-not(Test-Path -Path $NinjaGetEntryPoint)) {
    Write-Error -Message 'NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1 not found.'
    Exit 1
}
$NinjaGetParams = @{
    Operation = 'Process'
}
. $NinjaGetEntryPoint @NinjaGetParams
```

#### Update Mode

Update mode is used to process updates only. It will not process installs or uninstalls. This mode of operation is designed to be run on a schedule, for example once a day.

```powershell
$NinjaGetInstallPath = Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NinjaGet' -Name 'InstallPath' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'InstallPath'
if (-not($NinjaGetInstallPath)) {
    Write-Error -Message 'NinjaGet doesn't appear to be installed.'
    Exit 1
}
$NinjaGetEntryPoint = Join-Path -Path $NinjaGetInstallPath -ChildPath 'NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1'
if (-not(Test-Path -Path $NinjaGetEntryPoint)) {
    Write-Error -Message 'NinjaGetEntryPoint.ps1 not found.'
    Exit 1
}
$NinjaGetParams = @{
    Operation = 'Update'
    IgnoreBlockList = $false
}
. $NinjaGetEntryPoint @NinjaGetParams
```
