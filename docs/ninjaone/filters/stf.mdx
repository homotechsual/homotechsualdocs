title: Start Time Filter
description: The start time filter `stf` parameter.
---

The start time filter is, currently, used in the [Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs](../commandlets/get/Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs.mdx) commandlet (which maps to the `/v2/backup/jobs` endpoint if not using the module) and is used to filter the jobs returned based on the time the job started. It supports two modes of operations and five status values.

## Between start times mode

This retrieves jobs that started between the two datetime values specified. The values are inclusive.

```powershell
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -startTimeBetween @((Get-Date).AddDays(-1), (Get-Date))
```

This will retrieve all jobs that started between 24 hours ago and now. The `startTimeBetween` parameter takes an array of two `DateTime` objects. Under the hood, this is converted to a string in the format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ` and passed to the API as the following query string parameter:

```powershell
https://eu.ninjaone.com/v2/backup/jobs?stf=startTime between (2021-08-01T00%3a00%3a00.000Z%2c2021-08-02T00%3a00%3a00.000Z)
```

:::note[Time Zone Handling]
The API expects the time to be in UTC. The module will convert the time to UTC before passing it to the API. So you don't need to worry about time zones unless using the raw `stf` parameter.
:::

## After start time mode

This retrieves jobs that started after the datetime value specified.

```powershell
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -startTimeAfter (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
```

This will retrieve all jobs that started after 24 hours ago. The `startTimeAfter` parameter takes a `DateTime` object. Under the hood, this is converted to a string in the format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ` and passed to the API as the following query string parameter:

```powershell
https://eu.ninjaone.com/v2/backup/jobs?stf=startTime after 2021-08-01T00%3a00%3a00.000Z
```

:::note[Time Zone Handling]
The API expects the time to be in UTC. The module will convert the time to UTC before passing it to the API. So you don't need to worry about time zones unless using the raw `stf` parameter.

## Start time values

The start time filter accepts datetime values in ISO 8601 format. The module will convert the datetime value to UTC before passing it to the API.

## Passing a start time filter directly

Instead of using the `-startTimeBetween` or `-startTimeAfter` parameters you can use `-stf` and pass the filter string directly - don't HTML encode the characters though - the module will handle it. For example:

```ps
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -stf "startTime between (2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z)"
```
