title: Status Filter
description: The status filter `sf` parameter.
---

The status filter is, currently, used in the [Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs](../commandlets/get/Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs.mdx) commandlet (which maps to the `/v2/backup/jobs` endpoint if not using the module) and is used to filter the jobs returned based on the status. It supports two modes of operations and five status values.

## Single status mode

This retrieves backup jobs matching the status provided, for example:

```ps
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -status 'RUNNING'
```

This will return all running jobs. Under the hood in the module this gets turned into the following query param:

```ps
https://eu.ninjarmm.com/v2/backup/jobs?sf=status%3dRUNNING
```

## Multiple status mode

This retrieves backup jobs matching any one of the provided statuses, for example:

```ps
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -status @('RUNNING', 'PROCESSING')
```

This will return all running or processing jobs. Under the hood in the module this gets turned into the following query param:

```ps
https://eu.ninjarmm.com/v2/backup/jobs?sf=status in (RUNNING%2cPROCESSING)
```

## Possible status values

The possible values for the backup job status are:

* PROCESSING
* RUNNING
* COMPLETED
* CANCELED
* FAILED

## Passing a status filter directly

Instead of using the `-status` parameter you can use `-sf` and pass the filter string directly - don't HTML encode the characters though - the module will handle it. For example:

```ps
Get-NinjaOneBackupJobs -sf "status = RUNNING"
```
