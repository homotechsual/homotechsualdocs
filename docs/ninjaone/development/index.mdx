This page documents development workflows for the NinjaOne PowerShell module.

## Quick Start

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\bootstrap.ps1
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\build.ps1 -TaskNames build
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Quality\test.ps1
```

## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to the project, including:
- Submitting bug reports and feature requests.
- Opening pull requests with bug fixes and new features.
- Improving documentation and examples (note that most docs are generated from comment-based help, so doc improvements often come with code changes).
- Reviewing and providing feedback on open pull requests.
- Sponsoring development on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/homotechsual).

## Development Process

Improvements should be submitted via pull requests *against the `develop` branch*. This allows for review and testing before merging into `main` for release. The project uses a CI workflow to run tests and build on pull requests, and a separate workflow to handle releases when changes are merged into `main` and tagged.

PRs against main which are not from our `develop` branch will be closed without review, so please ensure you are targeting the correct branch. If you are unsure about the process or have questions, feel free to ask in the [Homotechsual Discord](https://discord.gg/NrCjh5ht7K) or the [NinjaOne Discord](https://discord.gg/NinjaOne).

## Repo Layout

- `DevOps/Build` - build orchestration scripts and build config.
- `DevOps/Quality` - test and static analysis scripts.
- `DevOps/Help` - comment-based help generation and orchestration.
- `Source` - module source.
- `Tests` - Pester tests.
- `docs/NinjaOne` - generated commandlet docs output.

## Bootstrap Environment

Bootstrap installs required modules, prioritizes bundled modules, and configures git hooks.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\bootstrap.ps1
```

If you need to force reinstalling dependencies:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\bootstrap.ps1 -Force
```

## Build

The build script supports multiple tasks:

- `clean`
- `build`
- `updateManifest`
- `publish`
- `publishDocs`
- `updateHelp`
- `generateShortNamesMapping`
- `push`

Build only:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\build.ps1 -TaskNames build
```

Default full build (clean, build, update manifest, publish help/docs, push):

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\build.ps1
```

## Tests

Tests run with Pester 5.x. By default, the test script also runs ScriptAnalyzer.

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Quality\test.ps1
```

Skip ScriptAnalyzer during tests:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Quality\test.ps1 -SkipScriptAnalyzer
```

## PSScriptAnalyzer

Run the standalone analyzer pass (uses PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1):

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Quality\run-pssa.ps1
```

The analyzer excludes `CustomRules`, `output`, `Modules`, and `test-rules.ps1`.

## Help Generation

The help orchestration script runs in phases:

- `Generate`
- `ApplyPublic`
- `Verify`
- `ApplyPrivate`
- `All`

Run all phases:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Help\Orchestrate-HelpGeneration.ps1 -Phase All
```

## Full Request Example Generation

The full request example generator injects a dedicated help example for POST/PUT/PATCH cmdlets that accept request bodies. It reads the OpenAPI YAML (downloaded by default) and inserts a help block between the explicit markers shown below. Existing examples remain untouched.

It requires a `ConvertFrom-Yaml` implementation (install either `powershell-yaml` or `Yayaml`).

```text
# FULL REQUEST EXAMPLE (AUTO-GENERATED) - BEGIN
# FULL REQUEST EXAMPLE (AUTO-GENERATED) - END
```

Default run (downloads the OpenAPI YAML from the EU tenant):

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Help\Generate-FullRequestExamples.ps1
```

Point at a local OpenAPI YAML file:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Help\Generate-FullRequestExamples.ps1 -YamlPath C:\path\to\NinjaRMM-API-v2.yaml
```

Target a single endpoint path:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Help\Generate-FullRequestExamples.ps1 -EndpointPath /v2/user/end-users
```

Target a specific cmdlet:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Help\Generate-FullRequestExamples.ps1 -CommandName New-NinjaOneEndUser
```

What it does:

- Downloads or loads the OpenAPI YAML and parses request body schemas.
- Builds a minimal example object from the schema (first option for oneOf/anyOf/allOf).
- Updates only the marked example block in comment-based help.
- Inserts the example before the .OUTPUTS section if no block exists.

Common parameters:

- `-BaseUrl` defaults to `https://eu.ninjarmm.com`.
- `-SourcePath` defaults to `Source\Public`.
- `-EndpointPath` and `-CommandName` filter the scope.

## Docs Generation

Regenerate the short name map and update docs output:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\DevOps\Build\build.ps1 -TaskNames generateShortNamesMapping,updateHelp,publishDocs
```

## Release and Versioning

- The build script accepts `-SemVer` to set a specific version during build.
- Publishing and release packaging are handled via CI and build tasks.

## PR Checklist

- Run `bootstrap.ps1` after pulling new dependencies.
- Run `build.ps1 -TaskNames build` before opening a PR.
- Run `test.ps1` (or `test.ps1 -SkipScriptAnalyzer` if PSSA is already run).
- Run `run-pssa.ps1` to validate style and quality rules.
- Update comment-based help and docs if you touched public functions.
- Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` is updated when appropriate.
- Review [Styling & Conventions](styling-conventions.mdx) for code standards.
- Review [Quality Gates & Code Standards](quality-gates.mdx) for parameter documentation.
