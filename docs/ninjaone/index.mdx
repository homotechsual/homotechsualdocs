## About

This module is a PowerShell wrapper for the [NinjaOne API](https://eu.ninjarmm.com/apidocs-beta). It is designed to make it easy to interact with the NinjaOne API from PowerShell.

## Installing

This module is published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NinjaOne/). You can install it using the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name NinjaOne
```

From time-to-time, preview releases will be published to the PowerShell Gallery. These are not considered stable and should not be used in production. You can install preview releases using the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name NinjaOne -AllowPrerelease
```

## updating

You can update the module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NinjaOne/) using the following command:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name NinjaOne
```

If you want to update to the latest preview release you can use the following command:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name NinjaOne -AllowPrerelease
```

After updating you should re-import the module in any open PowerShell sessions using the following commands:

```powershell
Remove-Module -Name NinjaOne
Import-Module -Name NinjaOne
```

## Getting Started

The first and probably most important requirement for this module is getting it connected to NinjaOne.

### Creating an application in NinjaOne

1. In NinjaOne head to **Administrations** > **Apps** > **API**

1. Select **Add** on the right-hand side to add a new API application.

1. Select the **Application Platform**.
It's important to decide what the best platform is for your needs as each offers different types of authentication and will be aimed at a particular use case.

1. Enter the **Name**.  
For example *NinjaOne PS Module*.

1. If you're going to need to use *Interactive Authentication* then you'll need to enter a **Redirect URI**.
You will need to use interactive authentication to access any endpoint that acts in a user's context. This is required to run scripts, access ticket boards and access various other endpoints.

1. Select the required **Scopes**
The *monitoring* scope is required to read information from NinjaOne, the *management* scope is required to write information to NinjaOne and the *control* scope is required for remote access via the API.

1. Select the required **Allowed Grant Types**
*Authorization code* is required for interactive authentication, *client credentials* is required for non-interactive authentication and *refresh token* is required to refresh an expired access token (usually used in conjunction with *authorization code*).

1. Save your new API application.
When you save you'll be presented with your **Client Secret** please store this securely and note that you will not be able to retrieve it again.

1. After saving you can copy your **Client ID** from the list of API applications.

### Connecting to NinjaOne

Once you have created an API application in NinjaOne you can connect to NinjaOne using the commandlet `Connect-NinjaOne`.

First we'll create a hashtable containing the required parameters for `Connect-NinjaOne`. This example uses the Authorization Code grant type which is used for interactive authentication and connects to the EU instance of NinjaOne.

```powershell
$ConnectNinjaOneParams = @{
    UseWebAuth = $True
    Instance = 'eu'
    ClientID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' 
    ClientSecret = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    Scopes = @('monitoring', 'management')
    RedirectURL = 'http://localhost:8080'
    Port = 8080
    ShowTokens = $True
}
```

We can use this hashtable to connect to NinjaOne using the following command:

```powershell
Connect-NinjaOne @ConnectNinjaOneParams
```

This uses the hashtable splatting operator (`@`) to pass the hashtable to the `Connect-NinjaOne` commandlet. To learn more about splatting see [about_Splatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting?view=powershell-7.1).

For more detailed examples of how to use `Connect-NinjaOne`, including using other authentication types see [Connect-NinjaOne](./commandlets/connect/Connect-NinjaOne.mdx).

### Running a command

Once you have connected to NinjaOne you can run commands against the API. For example, to get a list of all devices in NinjaOne you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-NinjaOneDevices
```

This will return a list of all devices in NinjaOne. For more detailed examples of how to use `Get-NinjaOneDevice` see [Get-NinjaOneDevice](./commandlets/get/Get-NinjaOneDevices.mdx).

## Known Issues

Many NinjaOne API endpoints require the use of a user's context. If you attempt to use these endpoints without interactive authentication you will receive an error similar to the following:

> Line |
>   28 |          throw ('This function is not available when using client_cred â€¦
>      |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>      | This function is not available when using client_credentials authentication. If this is unexpected
>      | please report this to api@ninjarmm.com.
