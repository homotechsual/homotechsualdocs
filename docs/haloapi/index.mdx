## About

This module provides a PowerShell interface to the Halo API. It's designed to for PowerShell developers to build their own PowerShell scripts and modules to interact with Halo. It's well tested for Halo Professional Services Automation (PSA) but should work with Halo IT Service Management (ITSM), Halo Service Desk and Halo Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

## Installing

This module is published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HaloAPI/). You can install it using the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name HaloAPI
```

From time-to-time, preview releases will be published to the PowerShell Gallery. These are not considered stable and should not be used in production. You can install preview releases using the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name HaloAPI -AllowPrerelease
```

## Getting Started

The first and probably most important requirement for this module is getting it connected to your Halo instance.

### Creating an application in Halo

1. In your Halo instance head to **Configuration** > **Integrations** > **Halo PSA API**  
This might be *Halo Service Desk API* or *Halo ITSM API*.

1. Select **View Applications**  
All going well you should be at `config/integrations/api/applications`.

1. Select **New** to add a new API application.

1. Enter the **Application Name**.  
For example *HaloAPI PS Module*.

1. Make sure you check the **Active** box.

1. Set the **Authentication Method** to *Client ID and Secret (Services)*.

1. Store the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** securely.

1. Set the **Login Type** and **Agent to login as** appropriately.  
*This setting determines who appears to be responsible for these API calls. You may want to create a dedicated agent user for this purpose.*

1. Select the **Permissions** tab.

1. Grant the application the permissions required for your purposes.  
*You should limit the API to only the permissions it needs to do the job you're scripting for.*

## Known Issues

Not all Halo's API endpoints have cmdlets but all documented endpoints exist in this module, along with many other undocumented endpoints. Want an endpoint / functionality implemented? Log an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/homotechsual/haloapi/issues) and if possible someone might add it, or you can implement it yourself.

For little used or one-off endpoints you can call `Invoke-HaloRequest` directly to reuse the same authentication token/connection and run arbitrary requests. See the [cmdlet documentation](./commandlets/Invoke/Invoke-HaloRequest.mdx) for more information.
